# Personal projects
	
Various non-work sites and projects that I have been involved in, interesting and fun projects that were great at the time.

## Websites / Apps

### Mini Canvases <Badge text="deactivated" type="warn"/>
##### 2012

`Imageeasel.com` was a company run by my brother producing miniature canvas prints from your own images. I helped him to build the website, including image upload and payment portal.


### Just Amazing Cards - iOS greeting card app <Badge text="deactivated" type="warn"/>
##### 2010

In July 2010 I released my first personal iPhone app. It was my brother's idea and he did all the design work. You could record messages, integrate your own photos, choose
backgrounds, borders, messages, fonts, etc and email the generated output to someone. [Demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sCfh85Mxk1Q).

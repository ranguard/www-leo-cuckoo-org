[My online slides](http://www.slideshare.net/ranguard)

## Conferences

I've been to [21 Perl conferences/workshops/Toolchain summits](http://act.yapc.eu/lpw2018/user/257) (starting in 2003)</a>, many of which I have spoken at. In addition to this I regularly attend the MetaCPAN core contributors hackathon and occasionally go to the [London.pm](http://london.pm.org/) meetings, though now more the [London Node User Group](https://lnug.org/) meetings.

## Serverless/AWS talks

Two talks I did for [YAPC::Europe](http://www.yapceurope.org/),
